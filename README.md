# Mapping_Earthquakes
Practice and Challenge for Module 13


## Purpose
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Commentary
I decided to keep the circles shrinking every time the user zoomed in onto the page. The shrinking circles allowed the user to zoom in on the smaller circles. 

The only main annoyance I had with the data was that the small circles for small earthquakes were occasional difficult to click. While I had no issue zooming in to find and click them, it did prove to be somewhat of an annoyance. While my personal preferences would have been to make the circles larger, I decided to stick with the specifications set by the clients.
